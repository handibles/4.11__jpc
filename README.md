# JPC ASV analysis

See analysis for the ```4.11__jpc__chunk_raw_assembly.sh``` for pre-processing and ```4.11__jpc__chunk__dada2_decipher.R``` for processing through ```dada2``` and some messy taconomic assignment. 

See also the ```4.11__jpc__subchunk__filtAndTrim-w-Figaro.R``` that uses Zymo's figaro app to determine cut offs on a per-sample basis.

Analysis assumes that raw reads are starting in a ```dir``` named ```/home/<user>/data/4.11__jpc```, and much of the large intermediate material is stored there (outside this repo).
